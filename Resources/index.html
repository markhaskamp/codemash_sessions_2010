Setting up the project structure keeping each artifact on a well identified location given its responsibility and type, defining the base schema for managing the application\u0027s life cycle, making sure the build is properly setup, and more. These are recurring tasks that should be handled by a tool or better yet, a framework. Griffon is such a framework. Inspired by the Grails framework Griffon aims to bring the same productivity gains to desktop development, there are so many traits shared by both frameworks that a Grails developer should be able to pick up the pace quickly.","Start":"2010-01-14T11:00","Room":"Mangrove","Difficulty":"Beginner","SpeakerName":"Andres Almiray","Technology":"Java","Track":"Rich Clients","SpeakerURI":"/rest/speakers/Andres-Almiray","Lookup":"The-case-for-Griffon-developing-desktop-applications-for-fun-and-profit"},

Cloud computing leverages virtualized resources to isolate the developer and user from details of the infrastructure, while spreading infrastructure capital expenses over a large number of hosted applications. Bill will discuss the realities of hosted applications, including the current popular ASP models, and compare them to cloud computing.

Suggestions on how to inject a little more functional style into your Java, and temper Scala with a mix of Object Oriented and Functional style.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAbstract:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRecently, while the Java platform has been going from strength to strength, improving both performance and support for alternative languages, the Java language has started to appear less exciting than many of the alternatives that now run on the JVM. There is a lot to be said for the modern features of many of these new alternatives, but does that mean the fat lady has sung for Java?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNot so, while we might still not have closures or properties, there are many new and interesting libraries and techniques that can breathe new life and style into your Java source. A stronger emphasis on immutable value objects, use of third party libraries like the Google collections library, DSL like fluent interfaces and more radical ideas like Project Lombok can all help you improve your style, reduce the boilerplate, reduce errors and be more productive with Java. It will bring fun back to your Java development.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe first part of this session will look at libraries and techniques that you can use with today\u0027s Java 6, and a peek ahead to Java 7.

Scala is one interesting option that offers static typing but with the same reduction of boilerplate and incidental complexity as many dynamically typed languages. Scala has a strong functional heritage, but also excellent support for Object Orientation, a fact that can greatly ease the transition to this new language. By starting with a mix of OO and Functional, the learning curve is lowered and the results are immediate. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn the second part of this session we will look at Scala, it similarities to Java, and it\u0027s easy access improvements.

You\u0027ll see how you can reduce the lines of test code you write by half and more, how to mix Scala into your existing JUnit or TestNG infrastructure, and how to use Scala in various testing styles, including unit testing, behavior-driven development, integration and acceptance testing, and high-level property-based testing. You need not already know Scala to attend this talk, as you will be taught just enough Scala to understand the examples.","Start":"2010-01-14T13:45","Room":"Mangrove","Difficulty":"Intermediate","SpeakerName":"Bill Venners","Technology":"Java","Track":"Dev Processes and Methodologies","SpeakerURI":"/rest/speakers/Bill-Venners","Lookup":"Get-Higher-with-ScalaTest"},
{"URI":"/rest/sessions/User-Stories-Closing-the-Agile-Loop","Title":"User Stories: Closing the Agile Loop","Abstract":"A large number of Agile adoption initiatives start at a grassroots level among software developers who have grown uncomfortable with the blatant inefficiencies of classic approaches to software development. The teams who succeed often find themselves working more efficiently, but the impact of their success is hindered. They are still relegated to taking large functional specifications and digesting them into iterations of work, with little if any feedback from the business side of the house. A series of successful sprints can still be met with the cliche &apos;that\u0027s not what we wanted&apos; response, leaving development teams relegated to the &apos;well that\u0027s what you wrote&apos; response. Until the business people are participating in iterative feedback and realizing the flexibility and freedom they have in working with these Agile teams, there will always be a ceiling on their success.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAttendees of this talk will be guided through pragmatic, proven approaches for building that bridge to the business representatives. A thorough treatment of how user stories can be used as an effective tool that allows business and development sides of the house to meet in the middle, as well as when and how to bend in order to move the adoption process forward. It will also cover the sometimes subtle pitfalls and hotspots of promoting a fully Agile process with participating business team members, and ways to hopefully allow good deeds to continue to go unpunished.","Start":"2010-01-14T11:00","Room":"Portia/Wisteria","Difficulty":"Intermediate","SpeakerName":"Barry Hawkins","Technology":"Java","Track":"Dev Processes and Methodologies","SpeakerURI":"/rest/speakers/Barry-Hawkins","Lookup":"User-Stories-Closing-the-Agile-Loop"},
{"URI":"/rest/sessions/DomainDriven-Design-An-Introduction","Title":"Domain-Driven Design: An Introduction","Abstract":"The first book on Domain-Driven Design was published in 2003, authored by Eric Evans, who first coined the term and distilled the time-tested principles and patterns that make up the practice of DDD. In recent years, simplification and increased testability through frameworks like Spring, Hibernate, and others has substantially reduced the complexity of application infrastructure, allowing teams to turn their focus to honing their approach to software design. Domain-Driven Design meets practitioners in that quest with principles, practices, and process to recapture the spirit of software excellence that has been lost in so many of today\u0027s technology practices.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis talk will introduce the foundations of Domain-Driven Design, and present several facets of DDD in action:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e* How models are chosen and evaluated\u003cbr\u003e* How multiple models coexist\u003cbr\u003e* How patterns help to avoid common pitfalls, such as overly-interconnected models\u003cbr\u003e* How developers and domain experts together in a DDD team engage in deeper exploration of their problem domain and make that understanding tangible as a practical software design","Start":"2010-01-14T15:35","Room":"Portia/Wisteria","Difficulty":"Beginner","SpeakerName":"Barry Hawkins","Technology":"Java","Track":"Architecture and Design","SpeakerURI":"/rest/speakers/Barry-Hawkins","Lookup":"DomainDriven-Design-An-Introduction"},
